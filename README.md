## RAG App with Langchain.js, OpenAI, and Supabase

This project implements a **Retrieve and Generate (RAG)** application using **Langchain.js** and **OpenAI**, with **Supabase** as the backend for storing conversation history and text embeddings. Key features include:

- **Text Embedding Storage**: Utilized **Supabase VectorDB** to store and retrieve text embeddings for efficient question answering.
- **Conversational Memory**: Integrated conversation history storage in **Supabase** to enhance context in responses.
- **Question Answering**: Combined retrieval and generation techniques to answer questions based on both sample text and prior conversation.
